## ATM Simulator

A simple ATM simulation that allows users to check their balance, deposit, and withdraw money with error handling for invalid operations.

## Cows and Bulls Game

A classic code-breaking game where you guess a 4-digit number with unique digits. The program gives feedback in terms of "cows" and "bulls" for each guess.

## Currency Converter

A command-line tool to convert amounts between USD, EUR, and CAD. It validates user input and ensures only supported currencies are used.

## Dice Rolling Game

Simulates rolling two dice. The user can roll as many times as they want and see the results.

## Number Guessing Game

The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. The program provides hints if your guess is too high or too low.

## Password Generator

Generates strong passwords based on user preferences (length, inclusion of uppercase, numbers, and special characters).

## Password Strength Checker

Checks the strength of a given password based on length, use of uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Pig Dice Game

A two-player dice game where players take turns to roll a die and accumulate points, but rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points.

## QR Code Generator

Generates a QR code from user-provided text or URL and saves it as an image file.

## Quiz Game

A multiple-choice quiz game that shuffles questions and keeps score. Uses colored output for better user experience.

## Rock Paper Scissors

## Simple Text Editor

A basic text editor that allows you to read, write, and save text files from the command line.

## Slot Machine

A slot machine simulation where you can bet, spin, and try your luck to win more money.
